User Stories:
Software Requirement Breakdown Structure:
Initiative -> Epics -> User Story

Initiative : collection of epics , drive towards common goal 
Epics : large bodies of work broken to smaller bodies work called user story 
User Story : Request from the end user 


What is User Story?
->A user story is the smallest unit of work in an agile framework
->It is a short requirement written from the perspective of an end user 
->written in non -tech language 
->Clearly define the functionality of end user expecting


User Story Format :
End User: User Type/Role
Goal: Functionality end user expecting 
Benefits: benefits the end user gets from the developed functionality 

Acceptance Criteria:
->set of conditions a product must meet to be accepted by a user,customer or other system.
->Each user story will have a acceptance criteria
->It is very useful to development team to get what user is expecting 
->It is most important to QA(Testers )team because they test the functionality (User Story) based on acceptance criteria.
->It will be written before the developement start.
->Each user story has correct and incorrect criteria of acceptance criteria.
->written by business analyst

3C :
Card ->Provides a simple statement
Conversation ->Creativity and Collaboration
Confirmation ->Tests the Acceptance Criteria are met


INVESTing in User Story:

Independent - Stories will not dependent on another stories ,So it can be developed and delieverd.
Negotiate - What?(Not give the solution but the needs) - Stories should not be written to such a level of detail that they become overly restrictive
                                                         and prevent your team from arriving at the best solution themselves.
Valuable - Why? - User Story should add value to the product.
Estimatable - Story should small enough to discuss and divide into task.
Small - the user story will be small enough to understand to complete in a single spring.
Testable - Acceptance Criteria.
